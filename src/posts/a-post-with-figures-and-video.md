A post to blah how a blog post looks on Hylia. Content is all set in the
“Body” field as markdown and Eleventy transforms it into a proper HTML post. You
can also edit the markdown file directly if you prefer not to use the CMS.

If you want to make an image bleed-out, add a title attribute to it and the front-end will automatically wrap it in a `<figure>` tag for you.
